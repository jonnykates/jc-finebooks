Text: 

Folio (510 x 445 mm.) Three volumes. Contemporary full panelled calf, worn, expertly rebacked to style at some point in the nineteenth-century, the spines divided into eight compartments with raised bands gilt, the second compartment in each case with a brown calf and gilt lettering piece, the remaining compartments richly tooled in gilt; Volume I comprised of an engraved title, an engraved calligraphic dedication, a leaf of introduction, 12pp. of text and 84 engraved plates numbered 3-100, including 14 double-page plates, each numbered as two (1-3 comprising the title, dedication and introductory leaf); Volume II comprised of an engraved title, 8pp. of text and 74 engraved plates numbered 2-100, including 13 double-page plates each numbered as two and 4 quadruple plates each  numbered as four; Volume III comprised of an engraved title, and engraved dedication and 73 engraved plates numbered as four, lists of subscribers in all three volumes; three of the folding plates in Volume I, lightly browned as often, the title page and the first engraved plate (dedication) in Volume II, slightly frayed at the lower margin, plate 62 in Volume I bound at plate 54. Although the boards are worn, this is nevertheless a lovely tall, fresh copy in a period binding, internally, unusually clean with wide margins.

Provenance: Charles Scrase Dickins, High Sheriff of Sussex, with his neat ink signature dated, 1834, to the head of the title pages.

An indispensable tool for the understanding of the development of the British country house in the latter half of the seventeenth-century and the first quarter of the eighteenth. The wealth of engraved plates illustrate the dominance of the English Baroque giving way to the rise of the Palladian movement under Burlington.

Text: 

8vo. (222 x 139 mm.) Publisher’s original cloth decoratively blocked lettered in gilt and blind; pp. xiv, [2], 276, 36p., publisher’s catalogue bound in at rear of volume, engraved portrait frontispiece, numerous wood-engraved figures throughout and five chromolithograph colour plates; ex-libris Tarradale House 1960, University of Aberdeen, with its book plate to the front pastedown; one small, localised water stain to the upper margin of the frontis, otherwise an especially bright, fresh copy.

Sixth edition. In listing the colour plates the publishers note that they ‘are indebted to the skill and experience of Owen Jones, Esq. for the production of the beautiful coloured plates which accompany this volume.’ The twelfth and final part of Jones’s *Plans, Elevations, Sections and Details of the Alhambra* was published in the same year as the present work. The *Alhambra* was at this date the most ambitious chromolithographed work ever undertaken and it is perhaps not surprising that Jones’s experience and skill were sought by other publishers.

As in previous editions the lessons of perspective, drawing and painting are conveyed by a series of dialogues between the author, his children and his pupils, the text enhanced by the addition of a large number of instructive illustrations after drawings by John Hayter.

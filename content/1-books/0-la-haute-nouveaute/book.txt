Text: Folio (411 x 316 mm.) Bound in the original quarter brown cloth in imitation of leather over marbled paper-covered boards, the upper cover embossed in brown faux leather with the name of the fashion house and date; pp. [2], 84, + [1]f., price list, with another folding price list bound in at the rear of the volume. There are around 200 fabric and faux fur swatches, generally composed of two or three larger samples and smaller samples in different colour ways  In addition there are a total of 23 colour printed mannequin designs after drawings by M. Küss, and as in previous examples by Brière and Lebotys, they demonstrate the use of the adjacent fabric in a fashionable design; a complete example with none of the swatches lacking, there is a very slight crack to the hinge of the upper board but it is intact, early pencil annotations to some of the pages, occasional light spotting to the upper margins of the stock, but overall a really lovely example, with the majority of the swatches as fresh as the day they were pasted into the catalogue.

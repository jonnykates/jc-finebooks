Edited by Arthur MacGregor, then Assistant Keeper in the Department of Antiquities at the Ashmolean, Oxford, The Late King’s Goods is a fascinating analysis of the growth of the royal collections under Charles I, prior to its dispersal following his execution in January, 1649. Essays by Ronald Lightbown, David Howarth, Francis Haskell, Simon Jervis, Donald King, A.V.B. Norman, Penelope Gouk and MacGregor himself, examine the various elements that made up the collections.

The bankruptcy of Richard Grenville, 2nd Duke of Buckingham and Chandos forced the sale of the contents of the ducal home, Stowe, a sale that extended over forty days during the August and September of 1848. Despite thousands of lots, the sale only realised a total of £75,562, 4s. 6d.

Notable lots included the ‘Chandos’ portrait of Shakespeare, the first portrait to enter the National Portrait Gallery on its opening in 1856, and an antique statue of ‘The Marine Venus’, purchased by Queen Victoria and given by her as a birthday present to Prince Albert, and subsequently installed at Osborne House.

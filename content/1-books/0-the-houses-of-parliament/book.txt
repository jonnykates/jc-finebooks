Publisher's original pictorial stiff paper sleeve (89 x 127 mm.), with detailed instructions for building the model printed on the verso, containing 12 cards and a stiff paper slip all printed with the elements necessary to complete the model of the Houses of Parliament; a bright, clean example, very good. 

Developed by Geoffrey Heighway in the 1930s from the traditional large scale card models that had been popular for many years. Small scale, portable, inexpensive and requiring little more than a modelling knife and glue, micromodels became a nation-wide phenomenon, particularly so through the war years. The first micromodels were a collection of sailing ships, these were followed by examples of military aircraft and warships. Subsequent collections were devoted to other subjects such as agricultural machinery, automata, railway locomotives and architecture. The latter included models of among other buildings, Hampton Court, Anne Hathaway's Cottage, and the present example, the Houses of Parliament.

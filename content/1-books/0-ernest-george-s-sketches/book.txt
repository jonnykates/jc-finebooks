Sole edition. By 1869 Ernest George’s architectural practice based in Argyll Street was well established and was starting to attract prestigious commissions. It was at this point that George decided to publish a series of anastatic prints after drawings that he had executed on architectural tours of the Continent in the mid 1860s. His skill as a draughtsman was well-known and the publication of the present work came to the notice of Ruskin who encouraged George to take up etching. Despite the fact that George states in the preface that these sketches ‘were too free to form a technical work and perhaps at the same time, too architectural to please everyone,’ architectural elements within them appeared in subsequent architectural work: the stable courtyard at Rousdon in Devon, for instance. Publication of his sketches in the form of books of etchings continued for a number years, in which he illustrated the urban landscapes of cities and towns in Germany, France and Belgium, as well as the cities of London and Venice.

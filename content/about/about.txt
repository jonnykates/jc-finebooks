Text: 

I have been in the antiquarian book business for almost thirty years. In 1986 I commenced working for Ben Weinreb Architectural books Ltd. I moved to Henry Sotheran Limited in 1987, where I ran the architecture book department until October 2016.

The business specialises in rare and out of print books on the history and development of architecture from classical times to the present day. We aim to stock a comprehensive range of books covering architectural theory, materials, construction techniques and aesthetics. In addition we will be offering books relating to the history of garden and landscape design, interior decoration and furniture as well as publications pertaining to the applied and decorative arts.
